# Overview
Content creators watermark their work to ensure they receive appropriate credit for their material.  Could we do the same for our Jupyter Notebooks?  This project experiments with ways to watermark one's own Jupyter Notebooks.

Side Note: Interestingly, the watermarks don't load when you look at the notebooks in [GitHub](https://github.com/brad-do/watermarking_notebooks)--I'm not sure why--but they do work when you run the notebooks locally.  Here are screenshots I took of each notebook before uploading to GitHub:
